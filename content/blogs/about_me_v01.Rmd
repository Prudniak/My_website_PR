# [Life in Warsaw]{.underline}

I was born and raised in the capital of Poland, Warsaw. Living in this great and vibrant city for so many years was an amazing experience, and I invite everyone to come to see it for yourself!

# [Bachelor's degree at Warsaw School of Economics]{.underline}

I enjoyed going to the primary, secondary and high school, as I met a lot of interesting people that got me inspired on everyday basis. Eventually, I decided to stay in Warsaw to pursue Bachelor's diploma in Quantitative Methods in Economics and Information Systems at [Warsaw School of Economics](https://www.sgh.waw.pl/en).

Moreover, the school gave me an opportunity to participate in foreign exchange programme at [University of St. Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/), where I have spent one incredible semester!

# [Professional life and the future...]{.underline}

After my first year of studies, I got into **PwC** as part of the WEX program, where I spent
a month in the business consulting department, where I had my first contact
with consultant work, in which I liked the way of approaching difficult
problems.

And it all made me decide to get into the research department at **McKinsey**, where I have supported
30+ different projects and developed insights into the energy and TMT sectors
in Poland. This has convinced me to do an internship as a junior business
analyst at **Kearney**, during which I have worked on a cost optimization project
for a leading Romanian telco.

In future I would see myself working as a data-analytics consultant in a strategic advisory company, however, I am open to all opportunities...
