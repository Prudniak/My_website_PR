<div id="life-in-warsaw" class="section level1">
<h1><u>Life in Warsaw</u></h1>
<p>I was born and raised in the capital of Poland, Warsaw. Living in this great and vibrant city for so many years was an amazing experience, and I invite everyone to come to see it for yourself!</p>

<h1><u>Bachelor’s degree at Warsaw School of Economics</u></h1>
<p>I enjoyed going to the primary, secondary and high school, as I met a lot of interesting people that got me inspired on everyday basis. Eventually, I decided to stay in Warsaw to pursue Bachelor’s diploma in Quantitative Methods in Economics and Information Systems at <a href="https://www.sgh.waw.pl/en">Warsaw School of Economics</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, the school gave me an opportunity to participate in foreign exchange programme at <a href="https://www.unisg.ch/">University of St. Gallen</a>, where I have spent one incredible semester!</p>

<div id="professional-life-and-the-future" class="section level1">
<h1><u>Professional life and the future…</u></h1>
<p>After my first year of studies, I got into <strong>PwC</strong> as part of the WEX program, where I spent
a month in the business consulting department, where I had my first contact
with consultant work, in which I liked the way of approaching difficult
problems.</p>
<p>And it all made me decide to get into the research department at <strong>McKinsey</strong>, where I have supported
30+ different projects and developed insights into the energy and TMT sectors
in Poland. This has convinced me to do an internship as a junior business
analyst at <strong>Kearney</strong>, during which I have worked on a cost optimization project
for a leading Romanian telco.</p>
<p>In future I would see myself working as a data-analytics consultant in a strategic advisory company, however, I am open to all opportunities…</p>
