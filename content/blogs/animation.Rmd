## Dataset introduction

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has a a very interesting
dataset on the adoption of about 200 technologies in more than 150
countries since 1800. This is the [Cross-country Historical Adoption of
Technology (CHAT)
dataset](https://www.nber.org/research/data/cross-country-historical-adoption-technology).

The following is a description of the variables:

| **variable** | **class** | **description**                |
|--------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| variable     | character | Variable name                  |
| label        | character | Label for variable             |
| iso3c        | character | Country code                   |
| year         | double    | Year                           |
| group        | character | Group (consumption/production) |
| category     | character | Category                       |
| value        | double    | Value (related to label)       |

## Data cleaning

```{r,load_technology_data}

technology <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-19/technology.csv')

#get all technologies
labels <- technology %>% 
  distinct(variable, label)

# Get country names using 'countrycode' package
technology <- technology %>% 
  filter(iso3c != "XCD") %>% 
  mutate(iso3c = recode(iso3c, "ROM" = "ROU"),
         country = countrycode(iso3c, origin = "iso3c", destination = "country.name"),
         country = case_when(
           iso3c == "ANT" ~ "Netherlands Antilles",
           iso3c == "CSK" ~ "Czechoslovakia",
           iso3c == "XKX" ~ "Kosovo",
           TRUE           ~ country))

#make smaller dataframe on energy
energy <- technology %>% 
  filter(category == "Energy")

# download CO2 per capita from World Bank using {wbstats} package
# https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC
co2_percap <- wb_data(country = "countries_only", 
                      indicator = "EN.ATM.CO2E.PC", 
                      start_date = 1970, 
                      end_date = 2022,
                      return_wide=FALSE) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value)) %>% 
  #drop unwanted variables
  select(-c(unit, obs_status, footnote, last_updated))

# get a list of countries and their characteristics
# we just want to get the region a country is in and its income level
countries <-  wb_cachelist$countries %>% 
  select(iso3c,region,income_level)

```

## Creating of a graph with the countries with the highest and lowest % contribution of renewables in energy production.

```{r min-max_renewables, out.width="100%"}

energy <- energy %>% 
  
  #filteting out the NAs
  filter(!is.na(value))
```

## Top 20 countries with highest % contribution of renewables in energy production

```{r top 20 countries}
top_res <- energy %>% 
  
  # dropping unnessecary columns
  select(-c(label, iso3c, group, category)) %>% 
  
  #pivoting dataset wider
  pivot_wider(names_from = "variable",
              values_from = "value") %>% 
  
  #filtering year 2019
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  
  #grouping by country
  group_by(country) %>% 
  
  #calculating the % of renewables in energy production
  summarise(total_res_perc = sum(elec_hydro, elec_solar, elec_wind, elec_renew_other)/ sum(elecprod)) %>% 
  
  #arranging in descending order 
  arrange(desc(total_res_perc)) %>% 
  
  #choosing top 20 countries
  head(20)
```

## Creating plot with Top 20 countries with highest % contribution of renewables in energy production

```{r top_plot}
top_res_plot <- ggplot(top_res, 
       aes(x = total_res_perc, 
           y = fct_reorder(country, total_res_perc))) +
  geom_col() +
     labs(subtitle = "Highest",
       x = NULL, 
       y = NULL) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  NULL
```

## Top 20 countries with lowest % contribution of renewables in energy production

```{r lowest}
bot_res <- energy %>% 
  
  # dropping unnessecary columns
  select(-c(label, iso3c, group, category)) %>% 
  
  #pivoting dataset wider
  pivot_wider(names_from = "variable",
              values_from = "value") %>% 
  
  #filtering year 2019
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  
  #grouping by country
  group_by(country) %>% 
  
  #calculating the % of renewables in energy production
  summarise(total_res_perc = sum(elec_hydro, elec_solar, elec_wind, elec_renew_other)/ sum(elecprod)) %>% 
  
  #arranging in ascending order 
  arrange(total_res_perc) %>% 
  
  #choosing top 20 countries
  head(20)
```

## Creating plot with Top 20 countries with lowest % contribution of renewables in energy production

```{r plot_lowest}
bot_res_plot <- ggplot(bot_res, 
       aes(x = total_res_perc, 
           y = fct_reorder(country, total_res_perc))) +
  geom_col() +
     labs(subtitle = "Lowest",
       x = NULL, 
       y = NULL) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  NULL

```

## Joining two plots together with 'patchwork'

```{r joining_plots}
res_plot <- top_res_plot / bot_res_plot + 
  plot_annotation(title = "Highest and lowest % of renewables in energy production",
                  subtitle = "2019 data",
                  caption = "Source: NBER CHAT Database")

```

## Creating an animation to explore the relationship between CO2 per capita emissions and the deployment of renewables.
